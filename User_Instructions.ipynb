    "\n",
    "## Part A: Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install **Anaconda** (free download) as a single-user installation.\n",
    "2. Open the **Environment panel**, click the **play icon**, and select **Open Terminal**.\n",
    "3. In the terminal, install the necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pymeasure\n",
    "    pip install pyvisa\n",
    "    pip install pyvisa-py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Install the **Spyder App** from Anaconda Navigator. You may also use another Python IDE if preferred.\n",
    "5. Download the code from GitHub:  \n",
    "   [https://github.com/kevcritc/Keithley2400_Control](https://github.com/kevcritc/Keithley2400_Control)\n",
    "6. Save the code to a directory in **OneDrive**. Measurement data will be saved in this same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part B: Making Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **Spyder** and drag in the `Keithley_2400_GUI.py` file (or open it manually).\n",
    "2. Switch on the **Keithley Source Meter** and wait for the startup sequence to complete.\n",
    "3. Click the **play icon** in Spyder to run the code.\n",
    "4. Once connected, a GUI will appear with two main modes:\n",
    "   - **Single Sweep Mode**: Sweep through current and measure voltage.\n",
    "   - **Full Loop Sweep**: Sweep from 0 A ‚Üí Imax ‚Üí Imin and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "> üìÅ Data is saved as a `.csv` file in the same directory as the GUI script.\n",

    "- Outer probes (1 & 4): Apply current\n",
    "- Inner probes (2 & 3): Measure voltage\n",
    "- Use shielded cables to reduce noise\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Keithley Configuration\n",
    "- Set **current range** according to material:\n",
    "  - Metals: 100 ¬µA ‚Äì 10 mA\n",
    "  - Semiconductors: 10 nA ‚Äì 100 ¬µA\n",
    "  - Insulators: 10 nA ‚Äì 10 ¬µA\n",
    "- Set **compliance voltage**: 0.1 V ‚Äì 10 V\n",
    "- Ensure proper grounding\n",

    "-  Always start with low currents and increase gradually.\n",
    "-  Use averaging techniques to reduce fluctuations.\n",
    "-  Check probe alignment before measurements.\n",
    "-  Use known reference materials for calibration.\n",
    "-  Record multiple measurements to ensure repeatability.\n",

    "# 7. Safety\n",
    "\n",
    " Ensure the measurement is done inside the earthed-box.  High currents and voltages can be easy applied particularly if poor contacts are made to the sample.  This can damage the instrument and cause electric shock.  It is important to switch the Keithley off when changing samples.  Do not use without training.\n",
