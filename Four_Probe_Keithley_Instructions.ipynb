    " Ensure the measurement is done inside the earthed-box.  High currents and voltages can be easy applied particularly if poor contacts are made to the sample.  This can damage the instrument and cause electric shock.  It is important to switch the Keithley off when changing samples.  Do not use without training.\n",

    "# 8. Voltage Sweeps\n",
    "\n",
    "Voltage sweeps can be performed using the voltage sweep panel.  It is possible to perform this 4W configuration but for low resistance materials/devices it is usually better to source current in 4W.  The default setting is for two-probe which delivers the voltage sent, and measures the current passing through the device/material.  Unless you have a special configuration/device then it is recommended to do these sweeps in 2-probe configuration, i.e. use the INPUT/OUTPUT connections only and leave the 4W check-box unticked.\n",
    "Start with low voltages and keep the current compliance low to protect the device and your safety.  Never disconnect or connect anything during a sweep. Click any of the stop buttons if somethign is wrong or switch off the Keithley if something is wrong and ask for help."
